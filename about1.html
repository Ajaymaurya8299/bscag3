        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Hello! My name is <span class="highlight">Ajay Maurya</span>, and I am currently pursuing a BSc in Agriculture. My dream is to improve the education system in our country and make education accessible to everyone.</p>
            
            <p>Although I have not yet taken any computer courses, I have learned a lot through my hard work and dedication while developing my educational app. This app is entirely educational, and my goal is to provide high-quality learning resources to students.</p>
            
            <p>Today, you will find many educational apps where you have to pay upfront before receiving education. However, my app is <span class="highlight">completely free</span>. The purpose of this app is to make education accessible to every student, regardless of their financial background. All resources and learning materials will be provided to you for free.</p>
            
            <p>I firmly believe that "dreaming big and never giving up" is the key to achieving our goals. I want my app to help every student reach their full potential, no matter what resources they have.</p>
            
            <p>If you believe that education is your right, I encourage you to try my app, and I hope you will find it helpful and motivating!</p>
